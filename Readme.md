A Mãos Tagarelas é uma EDTECH, que propõe trazer inovação nos cursos de Língua Brasileira de Sinais - Libras - e trazer inovação no contexto tecnológico e midiático para as pessoas Surdas. A Mãos Tagarelas vem desenvolvendo alguns produtos e um dos seus produtos é a HandsPlay - uma plataforma de Streaming de Filmes, Séries e Documentários 100% voltados às pessoas Surdas por meio da tradução-interpretação de Libras. O Brasil tem mais de 9,7 milhões de pessoas Surdas (segundo o IBGE de 2010) e desse número estima-se que 20% domina a língua portuguesa e o restante não domina a língua portuguesa e somente domina a Libras.

Assim, visamos atender as pessoas Surdas que dominam a Libras por realizar o serviço de interpretação nas obras audiovisuais e inserir na plataforma de streaming para ser acessível à pessoa Surda.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
